# Simulation Datasets

All of the simulation datasets and true graphical models used in our paper are in the directory 'files' in this repository. This includes all datasets in tabular form plus all true graphical models for the dataset
to compare results to. We include tabular data (instead of covariance matrices) because we 
realize some tools require it.
